* Sub-cortical brain tissue segmentation of MRI images using CNN networks

Some experiments using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for subcortical tissue segmentation. 
This is a /work in progress/. 

** How to use: 
This method is still under research, so it can be very buggy and not accurate. A precise description of how to use it will be submitted soon. 

** Configuration:
- Using the [[http://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Lasagne]] and [[https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn][NoLearn]] libraries.
